# File-Renamer
A Simple Python script that creates a GUI application using Tkinter for renaming files in a selected directory. The user can input a directory path, browse for a folder, and click a button to rename the files in that folder. The new filenames are serial numbers based on the order of the files in the directory.

This is a very simple project that can be built by anyone and is not that much special for anyone out there in the world. However, this is my first project that has had real world usage. The only client of this project is my father, who is a photographer. He has a client who prefers that all the image files in the folder should be named in serial numbers, for e.g, "1.jpg", "2.jpg", etc. Now we know, in windows something like this can be done by selecting all the files and pressing 1, but that results in "(1).jpg","(2).jpg", etc, which my father's client does not accept. So, for a long time without my knowledge he used to rename all the files manually one by one, which took hours. Recently, when I learned about this, I told him that this could be done in a matter of seconds. He wouldn't believe me. So when he used this tool built by me, he was amazed. He was proud of me. More importantly, I was proud of myself. I had used my knowledge to help my own father.
